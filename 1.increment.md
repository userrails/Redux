create-react-app increment
npm install redux react-redux

- go to App.js, remove line which imports logo, and everything inside <div
  className="app"></div>
- create counter component i.e. counter.js inside src/
//src/counter.js
import React from 'react';
function Counter(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>I am a counter!</h1>
      // also we need count which comes from props
      <p>Count: {props.count}</p>
      // we need event handler
      <button>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )  
}

export default Counter;

- Go to App.js
import Counter from "./Counter";
<div className="app">
  <Counter />
</app>

- Till here everything is plain React.
- Now to make count increment by 1, we are going to implement by Redux.
- Here is the picture:

Component     ->    Create Action
 ^                        |
 |                       `.`
 Reducer Runs  <-   Dispatch Action
 in the store
Fig: diagram1

Description: we have our react component, we will click on increment button which is
'create an action', we then 'dispatch the action' to `Store`, then store run
through it's reducer which will change the state, and it update the component.

 Now setup the store and default data.

step: 1
--------
go to Counter.js

import { connect } from 'react-redux';

// now we need a function which maps anything from state to props.

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  // console.log('mapStateToProps', state);
  return {
    count: state.count 
  }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Counter);
// what it does? This connect(mapStateToProps)(Counter) creates a new component, not our component
i.e. Counter, which hooks up function mapStateToProps to our component Counter
and finally we export it. connect() automatically creating a new component and
wrapping our component.

step 2: let us create actual store
------------------------------------
mkdir src/store/
touch src/store/index.js

// we need to import createStore from redux lib
import { createStore } from 'redux';

// create defaultstate / initialState and define a variable
const initialState = {
 count: 0
}

// we need to create reducer function which takes two arguments state, action

cont reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  console.log('reducer running', action);
  return state;
}

// now create a store
const store = createStore(reducer);

export default store;

step 3: just go to the app now which is App.js
---------------------------
import store from './store/'; // this takes store/index.js

// everything else is same as previous just call store inside div tag

<Counter count="5" /> change it to following
<Counter store={store} />

Till here we have created an store and Reducer which runs on the store. See
above Fig: diagram1.
Still it is remaining to create an action and dispatch it.

// now we need to create another function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) on
counter.js
// this dispatch is the dispatch of a redux

function mapDispatchToProps (dispatch) {
  return {
    onIncrementClick: () => {
      // this onIncrementClick will come on the props e.g Counter(props) like
      //props.onIncrementClick
      console.log('clickin');
     // it will not play in action unless you return mapDispatchToProps on
connect() method

    // now it's a time to play with an actions
    // action is an object having type property to know by reducers
    const action = { type: 'INCREMENT' };
    dispatch(action);
    // now this action calls on the reducer() which is inside store/index.js
    }
  }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);

// on Counter.js component
<button onClick={props.onIncrementClick}>increment</button>

Note:
mapStateToProps() is a utility which helps component get updated state
mapDispatchToProps() is a utility which helps component to fire an action event
